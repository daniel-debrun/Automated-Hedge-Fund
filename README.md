## Automated Hedge Fund

This project aims to create an automated hedge fund that mimics and potentially improves upon the investment strategies of politicians. It leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer models to analyze financial data and predict trading decisions. The core idea is to use RL to learn optimal trading strategies based on market conditions and, crucially, insights derived from politician trading behavior. Transformer models, inspired by projects like StockFormer, are central to forecasting future price movements and informing these trading decisions.

The project also considers ethical implications, ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in the use of these models.

### Transformer Models

This project will integrate transformer-based models, drawing inspiration from [Simple-Stock-Transformer](https://github.com/daniel-debrun/Simple-Stock-Transformer) and [StockFormer](https://github.com/daniel-debrun/StockFormer), to analyze time series data and predict trading decisions.
